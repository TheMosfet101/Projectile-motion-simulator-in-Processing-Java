# Projectile-motion-simulator-in-Processing-Java
Projectile motion simulator recreated in Processing Java. Includes the following features: Being able to input the values of the projectile's X/Y position, it's angle, and intital velocity. Being able to toggle on/simulate linear air resistance and inputting the projectile's mass, while seeing values of it's intital horizontal/vertical velocity, it's maximum time, maximum height, and range of the total flight. Finally, being to view the stats (Intital velocity, angle of projection, mass, X/Y position) at the end of a projectile's motion while being able to reset all of it's current values and paths made during it's run. Plus, you are able to view the vector diagram of a projectile's horizontal velocity, vertical velocity, total vector velocity, force of gravity, and drag force if air resistance is enabled. Free as an educational tool for learning.
